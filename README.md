# nuscenes2opendrive :car: :world_map:

## Description
"nuscenes2opendrive" is a tool to convert nuScenes map data to OpenDRIVE format. This aids in autonomous driving research by enabling the use of nuScenes data in OpenDRIVE-compatible simulators. :gear:

## Structure of the Tool :construction:
The tool utilizes Docker to build a container that facilitates the conversion of the NuScenes Dataset to xodr format. This is achieved by leveraging two online tools:
1. [nuscenes-to-osm-exporter](https://github.com/gdlg/nuscenes-to-osm-exporter.git)
2. [osm2xodr](https://github.com/JHMeusener/osm2xodr.git)
